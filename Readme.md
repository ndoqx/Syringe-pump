# IoT Syringe Pump | Third-Year Embedded Project at KMITL

ðŸ”— GitHub Repository: [ndoqx/Syringe-pump](https://github.com/ndoqx/Syringe-pump.git)

This project is a smart syringe pump designed during my third year as a Biomedical Engineering student at KMITL. Built with an ESP32, Ultrasonic Sensor, and a stepper motor driver, the system allows precise control of liquid infusion rate and volume via a mobile app (Blynk).

Users can remotely start, purge, or return the syringe motor while adjusting speed (ml/sec) and volume (ml) in real-time. Sensor feedback ensures controlled movement, and the system is designed for educational and prototyping use cases.

# Features

* Remote Start / Purge / Return motor control via Blynk app
* Adjustable infusion volume (ml) and infusion speed (ml/sec)
* Ultrasonic distance sensor for real-time syringe tracking
* Stepper motor control via DIR/STEP/ENABLE pins
* Real-time monitoring via Blynk Terminal and Display Widgets
* LED status indicators for operation and alarm states
* Serial output for live debugging

---

# How It Works

1. User connects to the Blynk app.
2. Sets volume and speed through sliders.
3. Presses buttons to begin Start, Purge, or Return operation.
4. The system:
   Moves stepper motor accordingly
   Uses ultrasonic sensor to monitor piston/syringe distance
   Automatically stops based on volume input or max range
5. Displays values on Blynk and Serial Monitor.

# Code Overview

Main logic is in `Syringe Pump.ino`.
Key components:

* `MotorOneStep()`: Executes infusion cycle based on set volume.
* `MotorPurge()`: Runs forward until full.
* `MotorReturn()`: Runs in reverse until minimum.
* `myTimerEvent()`: Sends real-time data to Blynk.
* `BLYNK_WRITE()`: Handles volume, speed, and mode inputs.

---

# Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ndoqx/Syringe-pump.git
   cd Syringe-pump
   ```

2. Open `Syringe Pump.ino` in Arduino IDE.

3. Install required libraries:

   * Blynk
   * HCSR04
   * WiFi (built-in for ESP32)

4. Replace Blynk credentials in the code with your own.

5. Upload the sketch to ESP32.

6. Use Blynk App to interact with the system.
